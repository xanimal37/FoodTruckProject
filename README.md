# FoodTruck Application
- This app simulates a food truck rating app. 

# Description
- The user can create up to five foodtrucks with names, food type and ratings. The user can display the food trucks or choose the one with the highest rating. If there are already 5 food trucks in the app, none can be added.

# Technologies Used
- Java, git

# Lessons Learned
- copied the code structure of the 'MadLibs' app as it seems like a good way to do things? I spent a lot of time looking at this app to understand the flow.
- copying the 'MadLibs' app structure helped me to understand how the 'MadLibs' app worked and what is a good way to structure programs
- for example, within the main method of the app, the app can be instantiated. Scanner can be passed to it and all its methods, which is a nice way to handle the pesky scanner. Also all methods can be called within the app OBJECT, which keeps the main method nice and clean with only an entry and exit point.

# Features
- I added a confirmation that the user entered the correct data for their truck. If they say NO, the truck is not added and the addTruck method starts over.

# Things I might like to add
- a way to delete food trucks
- a way to have unlimited food trucks
- more data options for food trucks
- a GUI but I have no idea how to do that!
